Official Tristan Language project compiler

## Docs

Docs are available [here](http://deavmi.assigned.network/secret/tlang).

## Building

To build you will need `dmd` and `dub` installed. You can then run the following:

```
dub test
dub build
```

The first command is optional but you want to make sure the compiler is working so you may
as well run all the unit tests - it won't take too long.
